# Desk Request - Office Desk Booking Android App

## Background
In the coming months and post-covid, many companies are planning a return to the office with a new hybrid employment model. This model will involve a way of staggering employees working arrangements in office spaces to meet capacity guidelines and social distancing requirements. The idea for this project came about when I knew the company that I work in will require a way of managing bookings for office desks and room space. The Desk Request Android Application will have a log in for Employees and they will be presented with a list of the rooms and offices on site. When the employee clicks on the room or office of choice they will be presented with the details of the room/office and whether a desk has been already booked or is available for selection. Once the employee selects a desk, they will be sent a confirmation email and the desk will be removed from the available list. Desk booking can be Half or Full day. Elevated User functionality such as a Facilities Manager will include option to add offices, desks, report on available desks and usage reports by date and users for a particular desk number in case of contract tracing requirements.

## Project Scope
Desk Request is intended to be run as a native Android Application and provide users with the ability to reserve an office desk when they are required to come to site to adhere to strict social distancing guidelines. The scope includes User account creation and authentication, list offices tailored to a companyâ€™s office setup, layout diagrams of each office showing available desks for booking, desk facilities (Monitor/Dock/Phone), reservation/cancellation functionality for a desk, Date/Time (AM/PM) & Calendar all via Graphical User Interface. Confirmation of a booking will be sent to users email. There will also be elevated User Privileges for Facilities Management to include additional offices and desks and a reporting UX where daily reports on desk usage, user bookings, close contact scenarios.
